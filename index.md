## About Me

I am currently a research intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://hughw19.github.io/">PKU EPIC Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.galbot.com/">Galbot</a> advised by <a href="https://github.com/42jaylonw">Jaylon Wang</a> and Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://hughw19.github.io/">He Wang</a>. <br><br>
<!-- I am currently a third-year graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Nanjing Tech University. -->
I may started from the bottom, but now I'm... well, still on my way up (slowly) ! And I really enjoy the journey on this (tough) way. 
I also play basketball and hit the gym a lot (but not really since been an research intern).

## Research Interests

I am passionate about exploring innovative technologies in **robotics**, artificial intelligence, and healthcare, particularly those with potential for **real-world implementation** and **societal benefit**.
