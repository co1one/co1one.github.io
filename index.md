## About Me

I am currently a research intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://hughw19.github.io/">PKU EPIC Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.galbot.com/">Galbot</a> advised by <a href="https://github.com/42jaylonw">Jaylon Wang</a> and Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://hughw19.github.io/">He Wang</a>. <br><br>
<!-- I am currently a third-year graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Nanjing Tech University. -->
I may started from the bottom, but now I'm... well, still on my way up (slowly) ! And I really enjoy the journey on this (tough) way. 
I also play basketball and hit the gym a lot (but not really since becoming a research intern).

I have extensive experience collaborating with international teams, am fluent in English, and am enthusiastic about connecting with peers for academic exchange, as well as exploring new research and career opportunities.
It would be my great honor to treat you to a coffee or a beer for an engaging face-to-face conversation! ‚òïüçª
## Research Interests

I am passionate about exploring innovative technologies in **robotics**, artificial intelligence, and healthcare, particularly those with potential for **real-world implementation** and **societal benefit**.
