## About Me

I am currently a research intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://hughw19.github.io/">PKU EPIC Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.galbot.com/">Galbot</a> advised by <a href="https://42jaylonw.github.io/">Jaylon Wang</a> and Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://hughw19.github.io/">He Wang</a>. <br><br>
<!-- I am currently a third-year graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Nanjing Tech University. -->
I may started from the bottom, but now I'm... well, still on my way up (slowly) ! And I really enjoy the journey on this (tough) way. 
I also play basketball and hit the gym a lot (but not really since been an research intern).
